# Sample Data for a 2x2 grid (100x100 total space)
# Cells are 50x50:
# Cell 2 (0,50) | Cell 3 (50,50)
#-------------------------------
# Cell 0 (0,0)  | Cell 1 (50,0)

# Case 1: Early Output. p1,q1,r1,s1 all overlap and are fully in Cell 0.
# Should be output by C-Rep Job 1.

# Case 2: Replicated Output. p2,q2,r2,s2 overlap.
# q2 is in Cell 0. r2 crosses from Cell 0 to Cell 1. s2 is in Cell 1.
# This tuple <p2,q2,r2,s2> should be marked in Job 1 and output by Job 2.
